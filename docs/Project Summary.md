# Project Summary

## Results and Evaluation

### Model Performance

After conducting feature engineering, the models achieved the following performance metrics on the test set:

| Metric    | Decision Tree | Random Forest |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| AUC       | 93.7%         | 91.0%         |
| Precision | 85.7%         | 88.7%         |
| Recall    | 90.4%         | 89.9%         |
| F1-score  | 87.9%         | 96.7%         |
| Accuracy  | 95.9%         | 93.5%         |


## Conclusion, Recommendations, Next Steps

The models and feature importances confirm that employees at the company are overworked. To retain employees, the following recommendations could be presented to stakeholders:

1. **Cap the Number of Projects:** Limit the number of projects that employees can work on to 5 or 6 maximum, initially starting with 5 to assess its effects.
2. **Investigate Four-Year Tenure Dissatisfaction:** Conduct further investigation into why four-year tenured employees are dissatisfied, including exploring potential factors such as a low number of four-year employees and underlying reasons.
3. **Address Overwork:** Find ways to reduce employee workload or adequately reward employees for working more.
4. **Restructure Environment:** Address potential issues such as understaffing or workflow inefficiencies to ensure employees do not feel the need to be overworked.
5. **Implement Team Rewards:** Reduce the correlation between high evaluation scores and overwork by implementing team rewards to foster collaboration and shared responsibility.

## Conclusion

The findings from the models and recommendations highlight the importance of addressing employee workload and satisfaction to improve retention rates within the organization.
