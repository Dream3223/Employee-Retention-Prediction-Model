# Predictive Modeling for Employee Retention

This repository contains code and documentation for a capstone project focused on HR data analysis and predictive modeling. The project aims to provide data-driven insights to enhance employee retention within an organization.

## Project Overview

The HR department of a consulting firm has collected extensive data on employee attributes and turnover. As a data scientist, the goal is to analyze this dataset and build predictive models to identify factors influencing employee attrition. By understanding these factors, the organization can take proactive measures to improve retention rates and mitigate turnover.

## Key Deliverables
